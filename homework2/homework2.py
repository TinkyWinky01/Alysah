# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path is the full path starting from the root directory. A relative path is the path from the current position.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute path: /python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2. Relative path: course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# It would permanently remove the current directory.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: Stages changes to be committed and tells git which files to track
# git commit: Saves staged changes to the repository.
# git push: Uploads committed changes to GitHub.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add adds all modified and new files in the current directory and then children directories. git add <file> adds only a specified file.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status shows the current state of the working directory. git log -1 shows the most recent changes in the repository.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning copies an entire repository to a certain file. Pulling updates the copy with the latest changes from the repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# "cp homework2.py ../../yourname/homework2/homework2.py": it kept telling me that there was no file under my name "Alysah", but the file was there! It was so frustrating, so I just opened up homework2.py manually.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# I'm confused as to how there was no directory for your name (which is where I correctly put my name).

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
