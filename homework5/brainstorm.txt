1) Five Interesting Topics

* Exoplanet detection and classification

* Black hole mergers and gravitational waves

* Climate change modeling with satellite data

* AI in astrophotography image enhancement

* Quantum computing for physics simulations

2) Three Topics

* Exoplanet Detection and Classification
Source: NASA Exoplanet Archive – https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/

Summary:
The NASA Exoplanet Archive provides detailed data on all confirmed exoplanets, including their masses, orbital periods, and detection methods. This dataset helps astronomers identify patterns and characteristics of planetary systems. It’s important for exoplanet detection because it allows for analysis on what kinds of stars and orbits are most likely to host planets.

* Black Hole Mergers and Gravitational Waves
Source: LIGO Open Science Center – https://www.gw-openscience.org/

Summary:
LIGO shares open datasets of gravitational wave detections from events like black hole and neutron star mergers. These datasets include strain data, which are tiny changes in distance caused by passing gravitational waves. Researchers can analyze this data to identify merger events and estimate properties like mass and distance.

* Climate Change Modeling with Satellite Data
Source: NASA Earth Observations (NEO) – https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/

Summary:
NASA’s NEO provides visualized global climate datasets, including temperature anomalies, CO₂ levels, and ice coverage. These datasets help visualize long-term environmental trends. They’re useful for understanding how climate variables interact and evolve over time.

3) Chosen Topic

* Exoplanet Detection and Classification

   * Loops and conditionals: To iterate through a dataset and identify planets that meet certain criteria (potentially habitable planets with Earth-like temperatures).

   * Functions: To calculate orbital parameters or estimate surface temperature from stellar and orbital data.

   * Lists/dictionaries: To organize planet data by star system or detection methods.

   * GitHub and version control: To collaborate with others and track progress as we refine data analysis scripts.

4) Project Ideas

* Dream Project (Ambitious):
Using a machine learning model to predict the habitability of a celestial object. It would use data from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive to train a model that predicts the likelihood of a planet being habitable based on its star type, orbit, and temperature. The project could include visualizations of habitable zones and generate reports on the most Earth-like planets.

* Smaller, Realistic Project (Few Weeks):
Exoplanet Data Explorer. I would create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook that reads exoplanet data (CSV from NASA Archive), filters planets by temperature and radius, and plots them on a scatterplot showing which are potentially habitable.
